# IOTA Snapshot Validation (8th August 2017)

This snapshot validates the latest proposed snapshot that will be used by IOTA core software. In order to execute this, first download the Snapshot.ixi (https://github.com/iotaledger/Snapshot.ixi) into your IXI folder.

Then modify the `iotaNode` provider on line 4 of `index.js`. **Make sure that your node is synced to the most recent solid milestone: `150354`**. After that, just run `node index.js` and notify the team about your results!
